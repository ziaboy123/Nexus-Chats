# Nexus-Chats

This is my A-level Computer Science Coursework. It has three main features. A direct messaging chat, an anonymous chat and a chat forum.

**Dependencies:**
* **JS Stuff:** On Visual Studio Code, first click on any of the files in client or server and then at the bottom of the 'explorer' tab you should see a tab called 'NPM Scripts'. On this tab there will be three files in each section called install. Click on these one at a time and wait for some dependancies to install.
* **Python Stuff:** On Visual Studio Code, cd into 'other-chats' and in the integrated terminal do 'pip install Flask' and 'pip install flask-socketio'.
* **NodeJS Stuff:** cd into 'client', 'server' and 'socket' and do 'npm install'.

**To run:** _(Do these in terminal and open a new terminal every two bullet points)_
* cd client
* npm run dev
* cd other-chats
* python app.py
* cd other-chats
* python main.py
* cd server
* nodemon
* cd socket
* nodemon
(I am trying to figure out a shorter way to run these)
